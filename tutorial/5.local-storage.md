#Local storage

To reset your workspace for this section:

```
git checkout -f step-5
```

Just as a show of how some things in Angular, once you have your head aroudn the basics, are so easy to accomplish. We are going to add local storage persistence to this application we have (simple though it may be). To do this we need to add a new package to our project. Run the command:

```
bower install angular-local-storage --save 
```

Reference this in index.html so your whole scrips area should look like:

```html
<!-- bower_components -->
<script src="bower_components/jquery/dist/jquery.js"></script>
<script src="bower_components/bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap.js"></script>
<script src="bower_components/angular/angular.js"></script>
<script src="bower_components/angular-local-storage/dist/angular-local-storage.js"></script>
<!-- bower_components -->

<!-- app-->
<script src="scripts/app.js"></script>
<script src="scripts/ArtistListController.js"></script>
<script src="scripts/ArtistService.js"></script>
<!-- app -->
```

The order you load scripts is important and is a common cause of errors.

First thing we have to do is add this module as a dependency for our app and set up the configuration for hte module. This is a common task that a lot of modules require. Replace your app.js contents with the following:

```javascript
angular.module('app', ['LocalStorageModule']).config(function (localStorageServiceProvider) {
  localStorageServiceProvider
    .setPrefix('music-app');
});
```

This has set up a local storage area for our application called `music-app`

Now lets inject that service into our ArtistListController so that we can persists when users delete artists

```javascript
angular.module('app').controller('ArtistListController', 
    ['$scope', 'localStorageService', 'ArtistService',
    function($scope, localStorageService, ArtistService){

        $scope.deleteArtist = function(artist){
            for(i = 0; i < $scope.artists.length; i++){
                if($scope.artists[i] === artist){
                    $scope.artists.splice(i, 1);
                }
            }
        };

        //the artists either are the oens in the store or go get them
        //from the service
        var artistsInStore = localStorageService.get('artists');  
        $scope.artists = artistsInStore || ArtistService.GetArtists();    

        //sets a watch on that store binding the $scope.artists to
        //the store 'artists'                          
        $scope.$watch('artists', function () {
            localStorageService.set('artists', $scope.artists);
        }, true); 

}])
```

As explained inline this code manages the storing of the artist objects in the local storage using `localStorageService`. There are two parts:

-The `localStorageService` gets the object store and if there are some there then the `$scope.artists` gets the value. Otherwise it falls back to getting the artists from the service.
-Then we set up a watch that binds the items in the $scope.artists array with the value in the `'artists'` store.

Now if we delete an item and refresh the page you can see that the item is really gone. The only way to get it back is to go into your developer tools in the browser (in my case Chrome) and delete them from the `Resources->Local Storage` area.

To remedy this annoyance lets just quickly add a reset button to our view. Update your form to look like this:

```html
<form>
      <label>Search: </label>
      <input ng-model="query"></input>
      <button ng-click="resetArtists()" class="btn">Reset</button>
</form>
```

Next we add the function `resetArtists()` to the controller:

```javascript
$scope.resetArtists = function(){
    $scope.artists = ArtistService.GetArtists();
};   
```

If you run this, you will notice you are able to delete the item and then reset once. But it doesn't work again... This is becuase of the nature of how services work in that they are singltons. We have attached that list of artists to the object itself and when we do the call the `resetArtists()` we set our `$scope.artists` object to reference the singlton services property. Then when we do a subsequent delete then we are actually deleting it from our service!

In the next section we are going to fix this by introducing an actual client http call to get json data rather than the hard coded data we have now.
