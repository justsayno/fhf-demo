#Two way binding

To reset your workspace for this section:

```
git checkout -f step-4
```

I are going to write some data back to our controller from the view by removing adding the ability to remove artists from the list. First there needs to be a user control that allows this and to get a nice looking icon lets use Bower to install font-awesome, a icon/font css library. Run the command:

```sh
bower install font-awesome --save
```

This will both downlaod the font-awesome library into the appropriate folder but it will save it in your bower.json. This way it is now listed as a dependency for you application and will be downloaded by anyone else who runs `bower install`

(from bower.json)
```
{
  "name": "fhf-demo",
  "description": "A demo project for Fly Home Friday at Intergen",
  "version": "0.0.0",
  "homepage": "https://github.com/justsayno/fhf-demo",
  "license": "MIT",
  "private": true,
  "dependencies": {
    "angular": "1.2.x",
    "angular-route": "1.2.x",
    "angular-loader": "1.2.x",
    "angular-mocks": "~1.2.x",
    "bootstrap": "~3.3.4",
    "font-awesome": "~4.3.0"
  }
}
```

Add a link to the font-awesome file in the header of your index.html

```html

  <link rel="stylesheet" href="/app/bower_components/font-awesome/css/font-awesome.css">
```

Change your `artist-detail` container html to:

```html
<div class="artist-detail col-sm-10">
      <h3 class="artist-name">{{artist.Name}} <i class="fa fa-trash-o delete pull-right"></i></h3>
      <h5>Stats</h5>
      <ul class="artist-stats">
        <li><strong>Genres: </strong><ul><li ng-repeat="genre in artist.Genres">{{genre}}</li></ul></li>
        <li><strong>Number of alubms:</strong> {{artist.NumberOfAlbums}}</li>    
      </ul>
</div>
```

And add the following css to app.css:

```css
.delete:hover{
    cursor:pointer;
}
```

Now we need to add some functionality to this. So far we ahve just been using values from the scope object but we can define functions on that object as well that can be called in our html with the `ngClick` directive.

```html
<i ng-click="deleteArtist(artist)" class="fa fa-trash-o delete pull-right"></i>

```

At this point I'm going to pull in a 

And in our `ArtistListController` we define the function:

```javascript
angular.module('app').controller("ArtistListController", 
    ['$scope','ArtistService',
    function($scope, ArtistService){

        $scope.artists = ArtistService.GetArtists();

        $scope.deleteArtist = function(artist){
            for(i = 0; i < $scope.artists.length; i++){
                if($scope.artists[i] === artist){
                    $scope.artists.splice(i, 1);
                }
            }
        };

}])
```

The function itself is quite simple it just goes through the artist array and deletes any that have the same name value as was passed in from the view. This deltes the items from the view in real time as the user clicks the trash icon. Obviosly in a real world application you would actually save that data back somewhere persistent.

In the next section we are going to look at doing just that with local storage in the browser.
