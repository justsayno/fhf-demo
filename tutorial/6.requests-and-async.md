#Requests and async

There are a few ways to do requests in angular but I am going to look at the simplest using a built in utility $http. Lets inject it into our ArtistService as well as a built in $q utility that is used for async promises. I have also taken out the data and put it into a file I created at the location: `app/api/artists.json`. Make your artist Service look like the following.

```javascript
angular.module('app').factory('ArtistService', 
    [ '$http' , '$q',
    function($http ,$q) {       
        return {
            GetArtists : function(name) {
                return [];
            }
        }
}])
```

And you should have a `app/api/artists.json`:

```
[{
        "Name":"Beyonce",
        "ImageUrl":"images/beyonce.jpg",
        "Genres": ["pop","rnb"],
        "NumberOfAlbums":"5"
    },
    {
        "Name":"Led Zepplin",
        "ImageUrl":"images/led-zepplin.jpg",
        "Genres":["rock"],
        "NumberOfAlbums":"5"
    },
    {
        "Name":"Kanye West",
        "ImageUrl":"images/kanye-west.jpg",
        "Genres":["hip hop","rap"],
        "NumberOfAlbums":"7"
    },
    {
        "Name":"Katy Perry",
        "ImageUrl":"images/katy-perry.jpg",
        "Genres":["pop"],
        "NumberOfAlbums":"5"
    },
    {
        "Name":"Taylor Swift",
        "ImageUrl":"images/taylor-swift.jpg",
        "Genres":["pop","country"],
        "NumberOfAlbums":"5"
}]
```

Now we need to remake our getArtists function in order to use $http to get the results from the json file:

```javascript
angular.module('app').factory('ArtistService', 
    [ '$http' , '$q',
    function($http , $q) {
        var getArtists = function() {
                var deferred = $q.defer();

                $http.get('api/artists.json').
                    success(function(data) {
                    // this callback will be called asynchronously
                    // when the response is available
                        deferred.resolve(data);
                    }).
                    error(function() {
                    // called asynchronously if an error occurs
                    // or server returns response with an error status.
                        deferred.reject("There was an error: ");
                    });

                return deferred.promise;
        }

        return {
                GetArtists : getArtists
        }
}])
```

Inside the function getArtists we are creating a deferred object which essentially is a special object that will fire off events based on if it is resolved or rejected. In this case we are using it to resolve and and reject on whether our call to our API endpoint was successful. We pass the data through on the sucess and give an error message on the error.

In the controller we call these functions like this:

```javascript
angular.module('app').controller('ArtistListController', 
    ['$scope', '$log', 'localStorageService', 'ArtistService',
    function($scope, $log, localStorageService, ArtistService){

        $scope.deleteArtist = function(artist){
            for(i = 0; i < $scope.artists.length; i++){
                if($scope.artists[i] === artist){
                    $scope.artists.splice(i, 1);
                }
            }
        };

        $scope.resetArtists = function(){
            $scope.artists = ArtistService.GetArtists().then(function(data){
                    $scope.artists = data;
                }).reject(function(error){
                    $log.error(error);
                });                                                                                         
        };

        //the artists either are the ones in the store or go get them
        //from the service
        var artistsInStore = localStorageService.get('artists');  
        $scope.artists = artistsInStore || ArtistService.GetArtists().then(function(data){
                $scope.artists = data;
            }).reject(function(error){
                $log.error(error);
            });

        //sets a watch on that store binding the $scope.artists to
        //the store 'artists'                          
        $scope.$watch('artists', function () {
            localStorageService.set('artists', $scope.artists);
        }, true); 

}]);
```

If you zoom in on what the we are doing here:

```javascript
 $scope.artists = ArtistService.GetArtists().then(function(data){
                    $scope.artists = data;
                }).fail(function(error){
                    $log.error(error);
                }); 

```

Our function `GetArtists()` returns a promise object which has a function called `then()` along with some others like `fail` which you can pass callbacks to. All we are doing in the callback is setting the `$scope.artists` to the data that has been returned. In fail we are using a new built in service I just injected called `$log`. Its an abstraction on top of console.log and should always be used for logging in AngularJs.

Now if you run the application you should be able to delete and reset at will!
