#Routing and templating

To reset your workspace for this section:

```
git checkout -f step-7
```

There are a few different routing options in AngularJS but I am going just showcase the standard version. The standard routing is `ng-route` and we need to reference it in our project. We already have it in our bower packages so just adding it to he index.html will do the trick. Your index.html scripts should looke like this:

```html
<!-- bower_components -->
<script src="bower_components/jquery/dist/jquery.js"></script>
<script src="bower_components/bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap.js"></script>
<script src="bower_components/angular/angular.js"></script>
<script src="bower_components/angular-route/angular-route.js"></script>
<script src="bower_components/angular-local-storage/dist/angular-local-storage.js"></script>
<!-- bower_components -->

<!-- app-->
<script src="scripts/app.js"></script>
<script src="scripts/ArtistListController.js"></script>
<script src="scripts/ArtistService.js"></script>
    <!-- app -->
```

##Templates

In order to really show of routing we need to make some changes to the way we have made our application. At the momeent all our mark up is in index.html. Lets create a new folder `views` and a file called `ArtistList.html` and copy everything from the div surrounding the artists list:

```html
<h1>Artists</h1>
<ul class="artist-list" ng-controller="ArtistListController">
    <form>
      <label>Search: </label>
      <input ng-model="query"></input>
      <button ng-click="resetArtists()" class="btn">Reset</button>
    </form>

    <li class="artist-item row" ng-repeat="artist in artists | filter:query">
          <div class="artist-image col-sm-2">
              <img ng-src="{{artist.ImageUrl}}">
          </div>
          <div class="artist-detail col-sm-10">
              <h3 class="artist-name">{{artist.Name}} <i ng-click="deleteArtist(artist)" class="fa fa-trash-o delete pull-right"></i></h3>
              <h5>Stats</h5>
              <ul class="artist-stats">
                <li><strong>Genres: </strong><ul><li ng-repeat="genre in artist.Genres">{{genre}}</li></ul></li>
                <li><strong>Number of alubms:</strong> {{artist.NumberOfAlbums}}</li>    
              </ul>

          </div>
    </li>
</ul>
```

Notice how I removed the ng-controller directive. Replace that content in index.html with:

```html
<div ng-view></div>
```

##ngRoute

Now we have our templates in place we need to do some configuration of our routing. Open up app.js and replace the contents with the following:

```javascript
angular.module('app', ['LocalStorageModule', 'ngRoute']).config(function (localStorageServiceProvider) {
  localStorageServiceProvider
    .setPrefix('music-app');
}).config(['$routeProvider',
  function($routeProvider) {
    $routeProvider.
      when('/artists', {
        templateUrl: 'views/ArtistList.html',
        controller: 'ArtistListController'
      }).
      otherwise({
        redirectTo: '/artists'
      });
}]);
```

We are adding another config function and this is setting up a default view for "/artists" and defining the tempalte and the controller for that view (the same controller we had defined inline earlier). This is all done using hte $routeProvider which we have access to becuase of ngRoute.

If you load the app you should have exactly what you had before but the url will be

```
http://localhost:8000/app/index.html#/artists
```

This is how angular takes care our routing and deep-linking in a single page app. You app is statefull and you can use routing to maintain and navigate this. There is another module called [ui-router](https://github.com/angular-ui/ui-router) which takes this idea much further and I suggest as the best option for routing at the moment. Alpha release Angular 2.0's new routing system has been back ported for 1.x as well which is a third option.

##More views

At the moment we only have one view. How about we make a view that allows us to drill into each artist (even though we don't ahve any more actual data to display!). 

First I am going to add a way to click on the artists title and this will bring us into a new view that has only that artist. Update your artistList.html to add the following attribute to the `<h3 class='artist-tite'>`:

```html
 <h3 class="artist-name"><a href="#/artists/{{artist.Name}}">{{artist.Name}}</a> <i ng-click="deleteArtist(artist)" class="fa fa-trash-o delete pull-right"></i></h3>
```

I have added an anchor tag with an href that links to `/artist/{{artist.name}}` which is going to be my new view. So lets set this up in app.js:

```
angular.module('app', ['LocalStorageModule', 'ngRoute']).config(function (localStorageServiceProvider) {
  localStorageServiceProvider
    .setPrefix('music-app');
}).config(['$routeProvider',
  function($routeProvider) {
    $routeProvider.
      when('/artists', {
        templateUrl: 'views/artistList.html',
        controller: 'ArtistListController'
      }).
      when('/artists/:name', {
        templateUrl: 'views/artistSingle.html',
        controller: 'ArtistSingleController'
      }).
      otherwise({
        redirectTo: '/artists'
      });
}]);
```

I've created a new view that uses the `:value` notation. This means we can pass through a value in the url and in this case its the name of the artist. Now even though this is all the information we have on this artist lets go ahead and make a function in our ArtistService to get a single artist by name. This is how it looks afterwards:


```javascript
angular.module('app').factory('ArtistService', 
    [ '$http' , '$q',
    function($http , $q) {
       var getArtists = function() {
            var deferred = $q.defer();

            $http.get('api/artists.json').
              success(function(data) {
              // this callback will be called asynchronously
              // when the response is available
                deferred.resolve(data);
              }).
              error(function(data) {
              // called asynchronously if an error occurs
              // or server returns response with an error status.
                deferred.reject("There was an error: " + data);
              });

            return deferred.promise;
        }

        var getArtist = function(name) {
              var deferred = $q.defer();

              $http.get('api/artists.json').
              success(function(data) {
              // this callback will be called asynchronously
              // when the response is available
                var artist = null;
                for(i = 0; i < data.length; i++){
                  if(data[i].Name === name){
                    artist = data[i];
                  }
                }
                if(artist){
                  deferred.resolve(artist);
                }else{
                  deferred.reject("Artist not found");
                }
                
                }).
                error(function(data) {
                // called asynchronously if an error occurs
                // or server returns response with an error status.
                  deferred.reject("There was an error: " + data);
                });

            return deferred.promise;
        }

        return {
              GetArtists : getArtists,
              GetArtist: getArtist
        }
}])
```

Now we have to add two new files, ArtistSingleController and artistSingle. Here they are:

(ArtistSingleController.js)
```javascript
angular.module('app').controller('ArtistSingleController', 
  ['$scope', '$log', '$routeParams', 'ArtistService',
  function($scope, $log, $routeParams, ArtistService){
    ArtistService.GetArtist($routeParams.name).then(function(data){
        $scope.artist = data; 
    });
}]);
```

(artistSingle.html)
```javascript
<div class="artist-single">
  <div class="artist-item">
    <div class="artist-image col-sm-2">
          <img ng-src="{{artist.ImageUrl}}">
          </div>
          <div class="artist-detail col-sm-10">
          <h3 class="artist-name">{{artist.Name}}</i></h3>
          <h5>Stats</h5>
          <ul class="artist-stats">
            <li><strong>Genres: </strong><ul><li ng-repeat="genre in artist.Genres">{{genre}}</li></ul></li>
            <li><strong>Number of alubms:</strong> {{artist.NumberOfAlbums}}</li>    
          </ul>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```

These are pretty self explainatory. The only real difference between the single and the list template is just removing that link however you could be pulling in aditional data from the service and displaying it here.

Don't forget to add the javascript references to index.html!

```html
<!-- bower_components -->
<script src="bower_components/jquery/dist/jquery.js"></script>
<script src="bower_components/bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap.js"></script>
<script src="bower_components/angular/angular.js"></script>
<script src="bower_components/angular-route/angular-route.js"></script>
<script src="bower_components/angular-local-storage/dist/angular-local-storage.js"></script>
<!-- bower_components -->

<!-- app-->
<script src="scripts/app.js"></script>
<script src="scripts/ArtistListController.js"></script>
<script src="scripts/ArtistService.js"></script>
<script src="scripts/ArtistSingleController.js"></script>
<!-- app -->
```

There is a lot more you can do with routing and this only scratches the surface.
