#Services

Services are basically small peices of functionality that can be injected into any controller or directive. This allows for great code re-use and testabilty. One great comment I have heard from an expereinced Angular developer is that if you controller is bigger than one screen maybe you should split it up. We are guilty of that in our application right now (especially since all our code is in one file currently)... Lets fix that.

##Tidy up

Up until now we have been doing everything in one javascript file. While this is good for demonstration purposes it is not very practical or maintainable. Lets fix this. Inside your scripts folder create two files called `ArtistListController.js` and paste the folling into it:

```javascript
angular.module('app').controller("ArtistListController", 
    ['$scope',
    function($scope){
        $scope.artists = [];
}])
```

Remove the controller from your `app.js` file which should look like this:

```javascript
angular.module('app', []);
```

We need to reference this file in our index.html so your script tags should look like this:

```html
<!-- bower_components -->
<script src="bower_components/jquery/dist/jquery.js"></script>
<script src="bower_components/bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap.js"></script>
<script src="bower_components/angular/angular.js"></script>
<!-- bower_components -->

<!-- app-->
<script src="scripts/app.js"></script>
<script src="scripts/ArtistListController.js"></script>
<!-- app -->
```

##Adding a service

There are two types of service, a factory and a service. The only real diference is the way that they are declared. In a service you pass a function which is essentially a construtor and attach methods to the `this` variable. In a factory you just return the object directly. I personally prefer factories as they seem more intuative to me.

Adding a service is very similar to adding a controller and this is the pattern used for pretty much everything in Angular. Create a new file called ArtistService.js in your scripts folder and add the following:

```javascript
angular.module('app').factory('ArtistService', function() {
    var artists = [{
        "Name":"Beyonce",
        "ImageUrl":"images/beyonce.jpg",
        "Genres": ['pop','rnb'],
        "NumberOfAlbums":"5",
    },
    {
        "Name":"Led Zepplin",
        "ImageUrl":"images/led-zepplin.jpg",
        "Genres":['rock'],
        "NumberOfAlbums":"5",
    },
    {
        "Name":"Kanye West",
        "ImageUrl":"images/kanye-west.jpg",
        "Genres":['hip hop','rap'],
        "NumberOfAlbums":"7",
    },
    {
        "Name":"Katy Perry",
        "ImageUrl":"images/katy-perry.jpg",
        "Genres":['pop'],
        "NumberOfAlbums":"5",
    },
    {
        "Name":"Taylor Swift",
        "ImageUrl":"images/taylor-swift.jpg",
        "Genres":['pop','country'],
        "NumberOfAlbums":"5",
    }];

    return {
        GetArtists : function(name) {
            return artists;
        }
    }
})
```

Reference this in your index.html so you have three custom scripts being referenced:

```html
<!-- app-->
<script src="scripts/app.js"></script>
<script src="scripts/ArtistListController.js"></script>
<script src="scripts/ArtistService.js"></script>
<!-- app -->
```

Now we can inject this service into our ArtistListController:

```javascript
angular.module('app').controller("ArtistListController", 
    ['$scope','ArtistService',
    function($scope,ArtistService){
        $scope.artists = ArtistService.GetArtists();
}])
```

If you run the app now you should get have the same diplay as you did before but now you could re-use that service anywhere you want in your application. 

There is a lot more to services and most of your application will be a series of services that are populating properites on your view model. This has jsut been a simple example of how you can seperate your data from your controller. Next we are going to look at two way binding which is the where the power of Angular really shines.
