#Services

Services are basically small peices of functionality that can be injected into any controller or directive. This allows for great code re-use and testabilty. One great comment I have heard from an expereinced Angular developer is that if you controller is bigger than one screen maybe you should think about splitting it up. We are guilty of that in our application right now considering everything is in one file... Lets fix that.

##Tidy up

Inside your scripts folder create two files called `ArtistListController.js` and one called `ArtistService.js` . Paste the folling into `ArtistListController.js`:

```javascript
angular.module('app').controller("ArtistListController", 
    ['$scope',
    function($scope){
        $scope.artists = [];
}])
```

Remove the controller from your `app.js` file which should look like this:

```javascript
angular.module('app', []);
```

We need to reference `ArtistListController.js` and `ArtistService.js` in our index.html so your script tags should look like this:

```html
<!-- bower_components -->
<script src="bower_components/jquery/dist/jquery.js"></script>
<script src="bower_components/bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap.js"></script>
<script src="bower_components/angular/angular.js"></script>
<!-- bower_components -->

<!-- app-->
<script src="scripts/app.js"></script>
<script src="scripts/ArtistListController.js"></script>
<script src="scripts/ArtistService.js"></script>
<!-- app -->
```

##Adding a service

There are two types of service, a factory and a service. The only real diference is the way that they are declared. In a service you pass a function which is a construtor and you attach methods to it with the `this` keyword. In a factory you just return the object directly. I personally prefer factories as they seem more intuative to me and sidestep the often misunderstood `this` keyword in JavaScript ([click here for demistification](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/blob/master/this%20&%20object%20prototypes/ch1.md)).

Adding a service is very similar to adding a controller and this is the pattern used for pretty much everything in Angular. Open the `ArtistService.js`file in your scripts folder and add the following:

```javascript
angular.module('app').factory('ArtistService', function() {
    var artists = [{
        "Name":"Beyonce",
        "ImageUrl":"images/beyonce.jpg",
        "Genres": ['pop','rnb'],
        "NumberOfAlbums":"5",
    },
    {
        "Name":"Led Zepplin",
        "ImageUrl":"images/led-zepplin.jpg",
        "Genres":['rock'],
        "NumberOfAlbums":"5",
    },
    {
        "Name":"Kanye West",
        "ImageUrl":"images/kanye-west.jpg",
        "Genres":['hip hop','rap'],
        "NumberOfAlbums":"7",
    },
    {
        "Name":"Katy Perry",
        "ImageUrl":"images/katy-perry.jpg",
        "Genres":['pop'],
        "NumberOfAlbums":"5",
    },
    {
        "Name":"Taylor Swift",
        "ImageUrl":"images/taylor-swift.jpg",
        "Genres":['pop','country'],
        "NumberOfAlbums":"5",
    }];

    return {
        GetArtists : function(name) {
            return artists;
        }
    }
})
```

Now we can inject this service into our ArtistListController and call the function to populate our `$scope.artists` array:

```javascript
angular.module('app').controller("ArtistListController", 
    ['$scope','ArtistService',
    function($scope,ArtistService){
        $scope.artists = ArtistService.GetArtists();
}])
```

If you run the app now you should get have the same diplay as you did before but now you could re-use that service anywhere you want in your application. 

There is a lot more to services and most of your application will be a series of services that are populating properites on your view model. This has jsut been a simple example of how you can seperate your data from your controller. Next we are going to look at two way binding which is the where the power of Angular really shines.
