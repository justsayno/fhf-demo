#Controllers and data binding

In this seciton I am going to talk about Angular contollers and data-binding

##Sidebar about directives...

Although I don't strictly need to explain this at this point I think that directives are something worth bringing up. In the core of Angular almost everything is a directive. We have already used the ngApp directive when we added the "ng-app" attribute to the html tag in the previous section. To quote the AngularJS documentation:

 >At a high level, directives are markers on a DOM element (such as an attribute, element name, comment or CSS class) that tell AngularJS's HTML compiler ($compile) to attach a specified behavior to that DOM element or even transform the DOM element and its children.

 In simple terms directives allow you to define your own html attributes/tags/classes with custom behaviours. For example I could make a hello world directive in my app like so:

 ```javascript
angular.module('app').directive('helloWorld',
    function () {
        return {
            template:'Hello World'
        }
    });
 ```

As you can see directives are just functions that return an object. This object has properties that map to settings for your directive. Since I did not define a `restrict` property this directive could be an element, an attribute and or a class. E.g.:

```html
<div hello-world></div>
<div class="hello-world"></div>
<hello-world></hello-world>
```

In the decleration above I defined a `template` with a string value of `'Hello world'`. This means the element that has been targeted by the directive will be replaced by the value "Hello World" once Angular has parsed the html. Directives are extremely powerful and even if they seem scary at first they are well worth getting into as soon as possible. The docs can be found here: 

[Directives](https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/directive)

Note: Html is not case sensitive so Angular converts your directive names from camel-case to hyphen-case for use in html. For example the above directive was named `helloWorld` in code but in the html it is invoked with the tag `<hello-world>`.

#Controllers

In an angular application controllers are used to get data from a service of some sort and pass it along to the view. In our case the view is our index.html page. The simplest way to add a controller to a view is to use the ngController directive. Lets do this and tell add a controller to our artist list.

```html
<ul class="artist-list" ng-controller="ArtistListController">
    ...(ommitted for readability)...
</ul>
```

If we loaded this in the browser now it would give you an error becuase there is no controller called ArtistListController defined anywhere yet. Lets go do that. Update your app.js to be:

```javascript
angular.module('app', [])
.controller("ArtistListController", function($scope){

});
```

Here we have called the "controller" function that is attached to our module `app` and we have registered a controller called `ArtistListController`. A controller is just a simple javascript function but notice a parameter `$scope` is being passed in. This is through the magic of AngularJS's dependency injection (DI). 

All controllers have access to the its `$scope` variable which is essentially your view model. Now there is one thing that we are missing and that is to annotate the dependencies in the code. This is useful when your code gets minified as the names of parameter variables might get changes and Angular's DI depeneds on the names of those variables. To do this you pass an array  to the controller function with the dependency names as strings first and the controller function as the final item in the array. E.g.

```javascript
angular.module('app', [])
.controller("ArtistListController", ['$scope', function($scope){

}]);
```

We have a controller, how do we add data to it? Lets start simple and put an inline array of the artists as objects into our controller:

```javascript
angular.module('app', [])
.controller("ArtistListController", ['$scope', function($scope){

    var artists = [{
    "Name":"Beyonce",
    "ImageUrl":"images/beyonce.jpg",
    "Genres": ["pop","rnb"],
    "NumberOfAlbums":"5"
    },
    {
        "Name":"Led Zepplin",
        "ImageUrl":"images/led-zepplin.jpg",
        "Genres":["rock"],
        "NumberOfAlbums":"5"
    },
    {
        "Name":"Kanye West",
        "ImageUrl":"images/kanye-west.jpg",
        "Genres":["hip hop","rap"],
        "NumberOfAlbums":"7"
    },
    {
        "Name":"Katy Perry",
        "ImageUrl":"images/katy-perry.jpg",
        "Genres":["pop"],
        "NumberOfAlbums":"5"
    },
    {
        "Name":"Taylor Swift",
        "ImageUrl":"images/taylor-swift.jpg",
        "Genres":["pop","country"],
        "NumberOfAlbums":"5"
    }];

    $scope.artists = artists;
}]);
```

Here I have declared an array that and added it to the `$scope` object by adding the following line after the array declaration:

```javascript
$scope.artists = artists;
```

Now we need to update our view in order to display this data instead of hardcoding it like we are at the moment. The basic tempalte for an artist list and item is the following:

```html
<ul class="artist-list" ng-controller="ArtistListController">
    <li class="artist-item row">
          <div class="artist-image col-sm-2">
              <img src="/app/images/artists/beyonce.jpg">
          </div>
          <div class="artist-detail col-sm-10">
              <h3 class="artist-name">Beyonce</h3>
              <h5>Stats</h5>
              <ul class="artist-stats">
                <li><strong>Genre: </strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Rnb</li>
                        <li>Pop</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Number of albums:</strong> 5</li>    
              </ul>
          </div>
    </li>
</ul>
```

To make this into a dynamic template I am going to use two build in Angular features. One is the ngRepeat directive which will allow me to repeat the `<li></li>` for each artist in `$scope` and the other is data binding using the `{{}}` notation. Replace the whole `<ul class="artist-list"></ul>` element with the following:

```html
<ul class="artist-list" ng-controller="ArtistListController">
      <li class="artist-item row" ng-repeat="artist in artists">
            <div class="artist-image col-sm-2">
                <img ng-src="{{artist.ImageUrl}}">
            </div>
            <div class="artist-detail col-sm-10">
                <h3 class="artist-name">{{artist.Name}}</h3>
                <h5>Stats</h5>
                <ul class="artist-stats">
                  <li><strong>Genres: </strong><ul><li ng-repeat="genre in artist.Genres">{{genre}}</li></ul></li>
                  <li><strong>Number of alubms:</strong> {{artist.NumberOfAlbums}}</li>    
                </ul>
            </div>
      </li>
</ul>
```

Lets break this down a little. Firstly we have declared `ng-controller="ArtistListController"` which means inside that div we have access to the $scope variable that was passed into our controller function. Using the ngRepeat we are telling angular to create a new version of this `li` element for each object in in the variable `artists` (which in our controller is `$scope.artists`). This means we can now use the `artist` object and bind to its properties by using `{{}}` syntax. I have also done another ngRepeat inside of this one to loop through and create the list of genres as well.

Also worth mentioning is how I used the directive ngSource. This is becuase otherwise the src of the image will be equal `{{artisl.Url}}` until angular has been bootstraped and ngSourse is the atttribute to use to bind to image sources safely.

Now add the following script tags to the bottom of index.html just before the `</body>` closing tag:

```
  <!-- bower_components -->
  <script src="bower_components/jquery/dist/jquery.js"></script>
  <script src="bower_components/bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap.js"></script>
  <script src="bower_components/angular/angular.js"></script>
  <!-- bower_components -->

  <!-- app-->
  <script src="scripts/app.js"></script>
  <!-- app -->
```

And try visiting the app url:

```
http://localhost:8000/app/index.html
```

Normally you wouldn't use ngRepeat in a real world application and there are major limitations to this method. However it is very useful for quickly demonstrating the power of data binding.

In the next section we are going to look at how to seperate our concerns a little more and use a service to move the data our of our controller.
